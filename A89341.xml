            <title>The necessity of Christian subjection. Demonstrated, and proved by the doctrine of Christ, and the Apostles; the practice of primitive Christians, the rules of religion, cases of conscience, and consent of latter orthodox divines, that the power of the King is not of humane, but of divine right; and that God onely is the efficient cause thereof. Whereunto is added, an appendix of all the chief objections that malice it selfe could lay upon His Majestie, with a full answer to every particular objection. Also a tract intituled, Christus Dei, wherein is proved that our Soveraign Lord the King is not onely major singulis, but major universis.</title>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet hee appointed one Supreme Vicegerent over them, and not many (for as for the <hi>Sanhedrine</hi> they were but as <hi>Moſes</hi> or the High prieſts Privie Councell, Or as delegated Judges becauſe of the multiplicity of buſineſſes) One I ſay and not many,<note place="margin">Judg. c. 10 <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> witneſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> 40. yeares betwixt <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan, Ioſhua</hi> neere 60. yeeres ſettling them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> after them <hi>Iudah,</hi> after him <hi>Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,</hi> then <hi>Ehud,</hi> then <hi>Shamgar,</hi> then <hi>Deborah,</hi> then <hi>Gideon,</hi> then <hi>Tolah,</hi> then <hi>Iair,</hi> then <hi>Iephthah,</hi> then <hi>Sampſon,</hi> But never above one at one time.

                        <hi>SECT. 1.</hi> Of the Primary Finall cauſe; as alſo of the efficient cauſe of all Civill Societies or Republiques.</head>
                     <p>Becauſe whatſoever is done, is done for ſome end or purpoſe, without which it ſhould not have been done, nor had a being: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the conſtant Doctrine of all Philoſophers, that the end is the chief and Principall of all cauſes: and therefore, for methods ſake I will begin with it. Now to find out the Primary end of all Civill Societies or Commonwealths, we, that are Chriſtians, muſt reflect attentively upon thoſe words of the holy Ghoſt. Pro. 16.4. <hi>Univerſa propter ſemet ipſum operatus eſt Dominus.</hi> By which we are aſcertained, that God Almighty created not only all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but all man-kind alſo, as for their Primary end, for himſelfe, and his own Praiſe and glory.</p>
                     <p>And as for man in particular, God created him to his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeneſs, endowing him with an underſtanding and a wil, that he might know how to honour and love his Creator, and by ſuch love &amp; honour might finally become happy in the fruition of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:130899:16"/> his eternall, unſpeakable and ineſtimable glory in heaven: for means whereto, firſt God dictated certaine Divine precepts and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples unto man, &amp; imprinted them with his very creation upon his natural reaſon (for which cauſe they are called divine natural Laws written in every mans heart, ſaith St. <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 2.15.) that every man might be equally capable to know them, and equally obliged to obey them. Secondly, God infuſed into him <hi>Faith, hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and other ſupernaturall virtues, all tending to this conduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that man following them as his guides, might, through his obedience to God, attain to his owne ſalvation. Thirdly, to binde man more ſtrongly to his ſubjection, and to make it appeare more illuſtriouſly unto him, that therein principally conſiſted his Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, as the very End and Center, for and to which he was created, He gave him an expreſſe divine Law, not to eate of the tree in the midſt of Paradiſe upon pain of death. Fourthly, by Revelation he inſtructed him in many particular ſacred formes and Rites of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour divine worſhip, as ſacrifice and other; for though we read not any where in holy Writ, that <hi>Adam</hi> offered Sacrifice, no more than we doe of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> yet we read there that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> did, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> did. But it cnnot be imagined that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were the firſt Inventors of this moſt, religious and divine worſhip, (no more than that <hi>Iſaac</hi> dd neglect it) but by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall tradition and example they received it from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. All which duely conſidered, it will appeare evidently, that the primary end for which all men are created, is to ſerve, honour, love, obey, and worſhip God. From whence it followes, that this being mans higheſt and principalleſt concerne, it ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be his higheſt and pincipalleſt care to attend to it. But moſt certaine it is, that men, living divided and ſcattered over the face of the world without the inſtruction and aſſiſtance one of another cannot poſſibly performe this for every particular mans behoofe, as is requiſite. And therefore from this finall cauſe aroſe primarily a neceſſity amongſt men to unite and combine themſelves into ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Societies and Common-wealths. This end could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed by men; but men were created for this end by God. And therefore this is the primary, ſpirituall, ſupernaturall, and divine fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cauſe of all Republikes, to which every other end muſt be but ſecondary, ſubordinate, and ſubſervient.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:130899:17"/>4 And from hence it followeth further, that ſince on the one ſide no naturall agent can by it's naturall power compaſſe the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſupernaturall end; and on the other ſide Civill Societies ought not to be inſtituted in vaine: we muſt needs conclude, that the Primary efficient cauſe of all Common-wealths is only God.</p>

                        <hi>PARAGR. 2.</hi> Of the Secondary finall Cauſe, and alſo the only Efficient Cauſe of all Civill Societies and Republiques.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 Every Creature in the world ſtrives to preſerve its own kind. We ſee what paines and Care Beaſts and Birds take to reare their younglings. Trees and Plants beare fruits and ſeeds to produce the like when they are periſhed. Yea, the inanimate Creatures (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their predominant Element and mixture) ſtrive every one to obtaine and enjoy their Center. And all this not only for their own particular, but alſo for the harmonious Accommodation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Vniverſe, the great and moſt excellent work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein ſhe doth nothing in vaine. But in vaine had man been, if he alſo had not been provided of neceſſary meanes towards the Preſervation of his kind. For which cauſe God ſaid it was not good for man to be alone: and therefore gave him a Woman to be his Helper, that ſo by meanes of generation he might propagate his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to the worlds end.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This Preſervation then of mankind, is the maine naturall and ſecondary end of man. And to ths end God gave him his bleſſing to increaſe and multiply, from whence ariſeth, that of neceſſity there muſt be at leaſt private families. But man and Woman finding (by wofull experience) moſt true what God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> that he ſhould eate his bread in the ſweat of his browes, that ſhe ſhould bring forth her children in paine, found alſo preſently, that every private family is not ſufficient of it ſelf to maintaine ths work of Preſervation, without the help of one another. For firſt, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of womens deliveries in chld-birth, which cannot poſſibly alwayes and every where be performed requiſitely by themſelves and their families, without the help of ſome other, or others: and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:130899:17"/> yet even upon this preſervation of mankind holds a moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and principall dependance. I will onely ſpeak of mans part, who with the ſweat of his browes, with extream toyle and labour muſt provide food and cloathing, and all other neceſſary ſupports and ſuſtentations for his family. But to doe this he muſt of neceſſity (I ſpeak not of barbarous inhumane people) have ſome certaine place of aboad; and in this he muſt have ſome peculiar right, ſome propriety of poſſeſſion, by vertue whereof he may reap the fruits of the earth, and maintaine his Cattel. And how ſhall every private family be able to doe this with ſecurity? will not every one ſtrive for the beſt poſſeſſion? will not the ſhepheards of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Gerera</hi> fall to contention for water and paſtures, &amp; ſuch like other neceſſary elbow roome? And in theſe uncivill and unſociable quarrells, muſt not all private families be made like to the fiſhes of the ſea. <hi>Hab.</hi> 11.13.14. where the ſtronger muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the weaker?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Secondly, God endowed man in in his creation with an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and a will. This underſtanding is of that infinite capacity, that it hath for its Adaequate Object <hi>omne ens</hi> as it is <hi>verum</hi> And man therefore is in perpetuall and reſtleſſe ſearch of knowledge, to perfect his underſtanding by experience and learning, The wil alſo hath for her Adaequate Object <hi>omne ens</hi> as it is <hi>bonum.</hi> And man therefore is in perpetuall purſuit of Reciprocall love to perfect his will by friendſhip and juſtice. Over and above theſe, God gave to man the faculty of ſpeech, to be the reciprocall conveyance of learning and friendſhip. So as for this very reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently wel, that man is by nature a ſociable creature, for neyther warning nor friendſhip, nor juſtice (in which conſiſts eſſentially mans Civill or Politicall happineſſe) nor ſafety or ſecurity (which is the only preſervation of every mans being) can poſſibly be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; maintayned in the diviſion of men in their priviate families. And therefore for this very end it was naturally neceſſary for men to unite and aſſociate themſelves into <hi>Civill Societies</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> that ſo they might preſerve thir Kind.</p>
                     <p>From the learning, experience and Induſtery of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing proceed all Arts, Tillage, Manufactures, Trade, and Traffique,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:130899:18"/> which bring in Gaine, and that brings plenty, from the friendſhip and juſtice of the will proceed Peace and ſecurity: in which ſecure peace and plenty conſiſteth perfect <hi>ſalus populi.</hi> Now ſince this cannot be had in divided private families, &amp; without this there can be no preſervation of Man-kind, it followes; that Civill Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Commonwealths are naturally neceſſary. Whoſe naturall finall cauſe is truely and onely (in the manner as I have explicated) <hi>Salus populi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now furthermore, ſeeing that Common-wealth is not the deſigne of Art and Invention of particular men, nor of any poſitive law of theirs, but proceeds from the Common neceſſity of all man-kind, intimated unto them by the Law of nature, of which God is the ſole cauſe and Author: it followeth that the efficient cauſe of all Republiques is onely God.</p>

                        <hi>SECT 3.</hi> Of the Finall and Efficient cauſe of Civill Power in a Commonwealth.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. As for the finall cauſe there is little or no difficulty; for ſeeing that the finall cauſe of every thing muſt needs be that, which that thing neceſſarily refers unto, as to its end for which it is done or hath its being: it is manifeſt, that ſince civill ſocieties have for their naturall and ſecondary finall cauſe <hi>Salus populi;</hi> the power alſo which muſt not be <hi>ad destructionem,</hi> but <hi>ad aedificationem,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe civill ſocieties, can have no other finall cauſe, but that whereunto they direct and are directed, which is <hi>Salus Populi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The materiall cauſe in whch this power originall, reſides and inheres; as the former to make up a compleat Body of a Common-wealth, is the people. And ſo the Obſerver ſayth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well in this kind of cauſe, power is originally inherent in the people: moſt certaine then it is, that even at the very firſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into a Civill ſociety, there is an inherent power in the people to governe themſelves, and by ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to preſerve themſelves in ſafety. For this is the onely neceſſary naturall end for which they met (as I have very briefely ſhewene before) that they might bee able and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:130899:18"/> powerfull to ſecure themſelves, and preſerve their kind. But this meeting would have been in vaine, and this preſervation wholly made fruſtrate, if there were not this power inherent in them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If in the naturall body of man there were not an interiour Directive Governing Power to guide every particular member in the operative uſe of its function, and to contrive thoſe operations to the mutuall good of one another, and the conſervation of the whole man; that body could not poſſibly but ſuddenly periſh. For if the teeth will not chew, nor the throat ſwallow, nor the hands reach, nor the feet ſtirre, nor the eyes look out, when nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires her neceſſary food, ſhe and they and all muſt ſtarve. So in a politicall Body; if all members ſhould do what they liſt, and ſhould not be compelled by ſome abſolute power to contribute their ſtrengths and endevours to the preſervation of one another, and the whole Community, it would be but <hi>Regnum in ſe diviſum,</hi> that of neceſſity muſt fall to deſolation, as the holy Ghoſt confirms alſo elſe where, ſaying <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.14 <hi>Ubi non eſt Gubernator dſsipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur Populus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 The maine difficulty is: who is the efficient cauſe of this power, Wherein, not to be tedious to my Reader, but to yield him the ſatisfaction of his expectation in a briefe and reſolute anſwer, I preſent unto him this Decretory Aſſertion. This power is not a humane but a divine Right; and God onely is the immediate effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe thereof. This I prove by five Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. There is a rule in nature (to uſe the Obſervers owne words) <hi>Quod dat eſſe dat conſequentia ad eſſe.</hi> But the <hi>eſſe</hi> of a Republike cannot have a <hi>ſimpliciter eſſe</hi> without the <hi>eſſe</hi> of this power. Therefore he that is the efficient cauſe of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, is alſo the efficient cauſe of this power. But (as I have prov'd before SECT. 2. <hi>n.</hi> 5.) God is the ſole efficient cauſe of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques, therfore he is alſo the ſole efficient cauſe of this power.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Primary finall cauſe of Civill Societies (as I have prov'd SECT. 1.) is divine worſhip, which man could not prefix to himſelfe as his end, but he was created by God for and to that end, and onely God prefixed that end to man. Therefore this is a divine end which cannot be atchieved without a divine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:130899:19"/> Power (as I have alſo proved in the ſame <hi>Section, n.</hi> 4.) onely God then is the immediate Efficient cauſe of this power.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And from thence it proceeds, that Kings, acknowledging themſelves to have received this divine power, principally for this primary end, their Oathes at their Coronation are (as the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver very grutchingly granteth) more preciſe in the care of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Priviledges, and of Biſhops and Clergy men, than of the Commonalty: and not from the reaſon which he gives. <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were penned by Popiſh Biſhops. For whether the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were Popiſh or Proteſtant, ſurely they are not to be blamed <hi>ex hoc capite,</hi> but moſt highly to be reverenced, that according to their profeſſion and duty they put Kings in mind, in the firſt place, of divine worſhip, and their owne and their peoples eternall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depending thereupon. And I cannot underſtand why the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver ſhould give that reaſon, but onely to ſeduce the Vulgar into a baſe and profane miſconceiving and vilifying of the royal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kings, and their ſacred Oathes. For Popiſh without all doubt in his Dictionary ſignifieth ſuperſtitious at leaſt, if not Idolatrous. But, if it be ſuperſtition for a man to be more preciſe in the care of Divine Worſhip, and his ſoules everlaſting ſalvation, than of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other his temporall end or affaire (ſee <hi>Section</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 3.) in vaine then have all Chriſtians hitherto believed that they were in a true Religion. Let the Obſerver conſider what cenſure he deſerves for thus finding fault with Kings Oathes, and whether hee gives not juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, that he is rather an Atheiſt than a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It is well knowne to all Chriſtians, that <hi>Quaerite primùm Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Dei &amp; juſtitiam ejus</hi> is no invention of Popiſh Biſhops, but our Bleſſed Saviours owne Doctrine and Rule, not only to Biſhops, but to all Kings and people whatſoever, as the principall, to which as an <hi>Acceſſorium</hi> followes, <hi>&amp; haec omnia adjicientur vobis. Mat.</hi> 6.33.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3 When private families firſt joyned themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Common body of ſociety, before any <hi>Condictum,</hi> Paction, or Agreement amongſt themſelves, to enact poſitive Lawes for their government, there was an inherent power in them to enact ſuch Lawes. For who can make a Law without a power? But this power, not being the effect, but the moſt neceſſary cauſe of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:130899:19"/> all humane pactions, or poſitive Lawes, cannot have its origen from man, but onely from God. <hi>Ergo</hi> God is the ſole Efficient cauſe of this power.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. When men firſt aſſociated themſelves into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, they were all of equall Right and Power, ſo that none (I ſpeake of ſeverall families ſtill as before) could challenge ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority the one over the other. For, this divine naturall power, <hi>viz. Se defendere, &amp; vim vi repellere,</hi> was inherent in every one of them, and obligeing them. The power then which accrewed to to the aggregation of the whole ſociety, was not made but brought, as being no other than what was in all and every particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that ſociety before. But that is a Divine power, and the immediate effect of God. <hi>Ergo.</hi> And indeed in the due mnnaging or excerciſing of this divine naturall law of <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> and <hi>vim vi repellendo</hi> conſiſts totally the ſecurity and <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> and the power of the Common-wealth to maintain it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. God Almighty is ſo ſolely the Legiſlator and Author of his owne Lawes, without the concurrence or conſent of any other Councell, (<hi>quis enim conſiliariu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>us fuit, aut quis pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or dedit ei? Rom,</hi> 11.33.) That they have their eſtabliſhment onely in and by his own will. So that no power whatſoever of his Creatures, can by any contraition againſt him, invalid or annull thoſe Lawes. But <hi>non occides</hi> is a Divine naturall Law and precept expreſſed in the Decalogue. Therefore no Pactions or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men can give this power of putting a man to death, no more than <hi>Cain</hi> could kill <hi>Abel.</hi> But on the other ſide it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that Republikes have a lawfull power of putting men to death, without which they could not preſerve their owne ſafety. Therefore they have it from God. And how ſoon God gave this power to men I know not, nor cannot find, untill after the floud; when <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we read this expreſſe poſitive divine Law and precept given to the Civill Magiſtrate. <hi>Quicunque effuderit hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum ſanguinem, fundetur ſanguis illius.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. The Finall Cauſe of Regall power muſt of neceſſity be the ſame that is of the Common-wealth, becauſe the King is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator of the power of the Common-wealth, to the ſame end no doubt, for which it was firſt ordained: of which having ſpoken largely before, I have no need to ſay any thing here.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The maine queſtion is, who is the efficient cauſe of Regall or Monarchicall power? Which the Obſerver boldly averres to be, not God, but the people. And upon this falſe ground he vents all thoſe ſwarmes of falſe inferences throughout his whole diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But before I lay down the true Reſolution of this queſtion, I muſt deſire my reader to mark with good heed the great difference that is between the power it ſelfe of a Common-wealth, and the authority to adminiſter that power: for the people may be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cauſe of this ſecond, though not of the firſt. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Aldermen of London may elect, nominate, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſuch or ſuch a man to be their Lord Major to adminiſter the power that belongs to the Corporation of that City; and herein they may be the Efficient cauſe of his Authority to adminiſter the power of the City, but not of his power; becauſe that is the gift of the King by his Charter, of which his Majeſty therefore is the onely efficient cauſe, and not the Aldermen, nor all the people of that Corporation whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I have proved all along in the precedent <hi>Sections,</hi> that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill power of a Common-wealth, is not a humane, but divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of which, not the people, but God onely is the Efficient cauſe. It is true indeed, that it is in the voluntary election of the people to authorize one, or few, or more with the adminiſtration of this power. And as long as this Authority is ſtill elective in the people, they may by conſent of the major part alter their forme of Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into Democraticall Oligarchicall, Ariſtocraticall, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, as they pleaſe. And herein the Obſerver ſaith truely, that God is no more the Author of Regall, than of Ariſtocraticall power: for whether this power be in many, or in one, it is ſtill the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:130899:20"/> ſame divine power of the Common-wealth, though diverſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, of which God onely is the efficient cauſe. But when the people have once reſigned up all their authority into the hands of one, and his heires for ever, ſo that now it is not any longer ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in them, but hereditary in him: then not onely the power, but the authority alſo to adminiſter that power is ſolely inherent in him and his heires, unalterably and irrevocably for ever.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This then is my firſt Aſſertion. The Efficient cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall or Monarchicall power, is not the people, but onely God. I ſpeak in this Aſſertion, not of conditionall Princes, but onely of abſolute Kings and Monarchs. My firſt proofe then is. When the people create a King, they elect his perſon, and authorize him with the adminiſtration of the abſolute power which is inherent in the whole Common-wealth to governe it ſelfe: otherwiſe he is no abſolute King, of whom onely I ſpeak, and ſo doth the obſerver alſo. But this power (as I have proved) is not an humane, but a divine power, of which God onely is the Efficient Cauſe. Therefore God onely, and not the people is the Efficient Cauſe of Regall power.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. My ſecond proofe, God ſaith expreſſely, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Per me Reges regnant, &amp;c.</hi> Then their Dominion or power by which they reigne is immediately from God. Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Pilate, Joh.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Non haberes poteſtatem, &amp;c. niſi tibi datum eſſet deſuper.</hi> Then this power is not from below from men; but from above, from God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom,</hi> 13.1. <hi>Omnis anima poteſtatibus ſublimioribus ſubdita ſit: non est enim poteſtas niſi à Deo.</hi> And <hi>qui reſistit Poteſtati, Dei Ordinationi reſistit.</hi> And, <hi>non ſine cauſa gladium portat.</hi> For what cauſe? <hi>Dei enim miniſter eſt, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ndex in iram, &amp;c.</hi> Then Regall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is Divine power and the Ordinance of God, wherein the King is not the peoples, but Gods Miniſter, as being inveſted and annoynted interiorly in his perſon by him with a Divine power; of which the exteriour Vnction is a ſacred, Ceremonous, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monefactive and ſolemne Teſtimony. And for this cauſe <hi>Gyrus</hi> though a Heathen King is called by God himſelfe. <hi>Iſay</hi> 45.1. <hi>Chriſtus meus,</hi> Gods own annoynted. The holy King <hi>Joſaphat</hi> ſaith to thoſe whom he had conſtituted <hi>Judge.</hi> 2. <hi>Paralip.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Non
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:130899:21"/> hominis exercetis judiciam, ſed Domini.</hi> Then it is not a humane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but a divine power by which the King doth judge and rule his people.</p>
                     <p>From hence I infer two Corollaries.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The firſt: That there is a two-fold truſt in the King. The one of his power. The other of the adminiſtration of his power. The firſt is Gods truſt unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to exerciſe his divine judgements. The ſecond, is the peoples, to adminiſter it <hi>Propter ſalutem populi.</hi> But if he ſwerve herein; ſeeing that the power is divine and reſiding and inhering onely in him, and not in the people, he is not liable to the people, but onely to God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The ſecond Corollarie. As God is the ſole efficient cauſe of Regall power; ſo the inſtrumentall cauſe which conveighes this power, is the divine naturall Law obliging men to unite themſelves into Civil ſocieties. For God gives a power to men to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by obliging them to unite themſelves. And conſequently the election of the people (with all the Obſervers pactions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements) is but <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> by way of approximation, that this divine power may reſide in thoſe few, or more, or one rather than in any other. As in my former example <hi>n.</hi> 3. The efficient cauſe of the Lord Majors power is onely the King. The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe by which this power is derived unto him, is the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the City, granted to them at pleaſure, more ſtrictly or more largely by the King. And the Aldermens election of this or that particular man, is but the approximation, that the Kings power may reſide in him to governe the City, rather than in any other.</p>
                     <p n="9">9, My ſecond Aſſertion. Every abſolute King (inveſted and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with a divine power by God himſelf to exerciſe his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through the election of the people to be ſole adminiſtrator therof) is in power <hi>ſuper totam Rempublicam;</hi> Superiour abſolutely over the whole Common-wealth. And therefore is not only <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor ſingulis,</hi> but <hi>Major Vniverſis,</hi> and <hi>ſuper omnes ſimul.</hi> This Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is evident out of the former. For the power that was inherent in the whole Common-wealth to exerciſe Gods judgements, and to governe and preſerve it ſelfe, was a divine power, not only <hi>ſuper ſingulos,</hi> but <hi>ſuper omnes ſimul,</hi> and therefore <hi>Major Univerſis.</hi> But this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130899:21"/> power is now totally and abſolutely inherent in the King only. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> he is <hi>ſuper totam Rempublicam:</hi> and <hi>Major Univerſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. In confirmation of this argument, I argue thus. Either the whole power of the Common-wealth is in one, or no. If no, then he is no abſolute King or Monarch, contrary to our ſuppoſition. But if he be a Monarch, I aske againe; if there be a powet in the Common-wealth, which is not in him, is it ſubordinate to his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or no? if it be ſubordinate, then his power is above that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo <hi>ſuper totam Rempublicam,</hi> and <hi>Major Univerſis.</hi> If it be not, then there are <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel</hi> two ſupream Civill powers in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, two ſupream contrary Maſters at once to be obeyed, one and the ſame individuall Kingdom and Gubernation, and yet divided againſt it ſelfe, which are moſt abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. From hence it is evident, that his Majeſty ſayd moſt truely, and moſt learnedly; that the adminiſtration of the whole power of the Common-wealth being committed in truſt abſolutely and irrevocably to him and his heires for ever, it is impoſſible that a power above that truſt ſhould be committed to others.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. This the Obſerver in effect plainly confeſſeth. But relapſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wonted Paroxiſmes of ſtrong malice againſt Regall Power, he labours (by his moſt falſe erroneous Principle <hi>Rex eſt minor U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſis</hi>) and tires himſelfe in vaine to anſwer it. And becauſe the ſtrength of all his long tedious and farraginous diſcourſe depends wholly upon theſe two falſe grounds, <hi>viZ.</hi> that the people is the efficient cauſe of Regall power; And that <hi>Rex eſt minor Univerſis;</hi> and I have manifeſtly confuted them both: I preſume I have alſo ſufficiently confuted all the reſt; and therefore conclude in thoſe ſacred words, <hi>Data eſt a Domino Poteſtas Regibus, &amp; virtus ab Altiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo.</hi> Power is given to Kings of the Lord, and Soveraignty from the higheſt. <hi>Sapient.</hi> 6.3.</p>
